# Chapter 5 - How programmers work
This chapter covers
- The different phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
  - Phase 1: Design and Analysis
  - Phase 2: Coding
    - Version control systems (distributed vs centralised)
    - Branching and merging
  - Phase 3: Testing
    - Unit testing, continuous integration (CI)
    - Test environments
  - Phase 4: Release
    - Different ways of deploying applications (PaaS, containers)
    - Build processes
    - Database migration
  - Phase 5: Post-release testing and observation
    - Penetration testing
    - Monitoring and logging
- Managing dependencies

## Phase 1: Design and Analysis
The SDLC doesn't start with code being written, but doing research and coming up with ideas about
what the software/website will accomplish. Figuring out aims before deploying a piece of software
is important, because it's harder to make changes to something after it's deployed instead of
before - even if it's a website (because you might have to maintain backwards compatibility, etc).

You need to figure out the requirements of the project. This either means meeting with stakeholders
(whether they're internal or external) and coming up with a list of goals that the project should
accomplish once it's complete. Once the coding begins, all the team members should be able to track
progress towards meeting these requirements/goals, and the project will be finished once all those
goals are met.
