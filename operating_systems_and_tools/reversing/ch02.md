# Low-Level Software

## High-Level Perspectives
The following are some notes on basic software development concepts

- Encapsulation - breaking down large programs into basic parts ("black boxes")
  - Modules: binary files that contain isolated aresas of a program's executable. Two types:
    - Static libraries
      - Usually represent a feature/area of functionality in a program
      - Embedded in a program when it is built/packaged
      - Therefore hard to separate from main program code in a low-level view
    - Dynamic libraries
      - Not embedded into program - in a separate file somewhere on the host system
      - Easy to detect when reversing
        - Gives hints to program's structure
  - Procedures (i.e. functions)
  - Objects - program components that have both data and code associated
    - OOP concepts: private/public, clients, inheritance, polymorphism
- Data management
  - Variables
  - User defined data structures - important to be able to properly identify them and understand the
    fields they contain
  - Lists - a group of associated data. Can be arranged in memory in different ways:
    - Arrays: list resides in a section of memory, items ordered sequentially within that section
    - Linked lists: each item can reside anywhere in memory, but needs a link (pointer) to the next
     item
      - This makes it easier to mutate items in the middle of the list, compared to arrays
    - Trees: like a linked list but with two links
      - Root node is the median object, which links to upper quartile and lower quartile. Think
        binary search
- Control flow: conditional blocks (`if`s), switch blocks (or *n-way conditionals*), loops
