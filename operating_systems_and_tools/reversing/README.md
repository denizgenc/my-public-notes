The book will go into x86 assembly in chapter 2. I have some earlier notes on x86 assembly that can
be found here: [x86\_architecture\_basics.md](../x86_architecture_basics.md) - however those notes
were based on a book that was trying to teach assembly with a "high-level" assembly language, so it
was kind of hard to just focus on stuff that was straight x86. I imagine the notes I take from
chapter 2 in this book will be more focused and therefore better.
