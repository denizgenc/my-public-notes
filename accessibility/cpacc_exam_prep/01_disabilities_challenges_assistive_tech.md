# A. Theoretical Models of Disability
## Overview
15% of world population is disabled - largest and fastest growing minority.

Society is finally moving towards being more inclusive of this minority, and we need to understand
what disabled people need, what they don't need, and what we can do to support them.

People view disability in different ways; none of these views (or models) of disability is complete,
but by studying multiple we get a more complete picture of what it means to be disabled in society.
Common **theoretical models** are social, medical, biopsychosocial and functional solutions.
