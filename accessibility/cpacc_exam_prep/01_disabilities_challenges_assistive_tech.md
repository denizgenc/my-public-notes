# A. Theoretical Models of Disability
## Overview
15% of world population is disabled - largest and fastest growing minority.

Society is finally moving towards being more inclusive of this minority, and we need to understand
what disabled people need, what they don't need, and what we can do to support them.

People view disability in different ways; none of these views (or models) of disability is complete,
but by studying multiple we get a more complete picture of what it means to be disabled in society.
Common **theoretical models** are social, medical, biopsychosocial and functional solutions.

## Medical Model of Disability
Summary: **The impairment is the problem**

In the medical model, the main issue that disability presents is perceived to be medical care;
politically, it focuses attention on health care policy.

It can reduce disability to an issue that only affects an individual, and that it essentially
creates a "baseline" of function that allows us to differentiate able bodied/minded and disabled
people.

### Strengths
- Addresses the biological sources of disabilities, potentially with cures or with ways of managing
  them
- "The medical component of disabilities is a critical reality for many people."

### Weaknesses
- Overlooks broader social/political/environmental conditions that disables/further impairs people
  with disabilities.

## Social Model of Disability
Summary: **The structures within society are the problem.**

In the social model, the cause of disability lies within the society and environment that disabled
people find themselves in. This is because things are designed with only able bodied/minded people
as the target, with little (or only retroactive) consideration for disabled people.

Therefore the issues are with re-aligning society in order to integrate disabled people better. The
onus is put on designers, architects, organisers, etc to be accessible, not for disabled
people to make adjustments themselves.

### Strengths
- Tries to achieve a society that is accessible by default
- Provides the perspective that *being impaired is not inherent to disability*

### Weaknesses
- May downplay medical causes of disability; and interventions that help
- "The social model's push for social justice in the political arena can also put activists at odds
  with people with other political interests." ????? Fuck off lmao

## Biopsychosocial Model of Disability
Summary: **A synthesis of the medical and social models.**

The WHO published the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, which
said:

> A better model of disability, in short, is one that synthesizes what is true in the medical and
> social models, without making the mistake each makes in reducing the whole, complex notion of
> disability to one of its aspects. This more useful model of disability might be called the
> biopsychosocial model. ICF is based on this model

### Strengths
- Focuses on environmental factors, while promoting self-efficacy for people with disabilities
- Also promotes social support

### Weaknesses
- More complex than the previous two models, can be harder to understand especially for
  non-professionals.

## Economic Model of Disability
Summary: **Disability in terms of impact on productivity and the material cost it has to employers
and the state.**

[Where have I seen this model
before?](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:EuthanasiePropaganda.jpg#/media/File:EuthanasiePropaganda.jpg)

Related to the "charity model".

### Strengths
- Recognises limitations on someone's ability to work
- Acknowledges need for economic support and disability

### Weaknesses
- Creates legally-defined category of people who are "needy", which is stimatising
  - This also creates the problem that some people who are disabled who might not meet the (often
    arbitrary) thresholds, which causes stress for both the disabled and wider society. Think DWP
    disability assessments.
- Essentially fascist

## Functional Solutions Model
Summary: **Focusing on functional limitations that disability causes in order to create and promote
solutions for them**.

This is the primary model used by accessibility professionals (we can't provide medical or social
interventions ourselves, after all).

Pragmatist - deemphasising sociopolitical aspects of disability, in favour of inventiveness and
entrepeneurship

### Strengths
- Results oriented

### Weaknesses
- Solutions may be innovative but not practical (especially if they're expensive)
- If the primary challenge of a disability is sociopolitical, functional solutions aren't very
  helpful.

## Social Identity or Cultural Affiliation Model
Summary: **Disability as a mark of identity and membership of a group.**

Most evident among the Deaf community, who originated this model. Not hearing loss, but deaf gain.

### Strengths
- Disability as a point of pride instead of an obstacle
- Creating community makes it easier to advocate for change

### Weaknesses
- Can exclude some that feel they don't fit the group's expectations
- Strong affiliation with a group can alienate its members from wider society

## Charity Model
Summary: **Disabled people are unfortunate and needy**

### Strengths
Can inspire people to help

### Weaknesses
Patronising

# B. Categories and Characteristics of Disabilities and Associated Barriers

## Stuff I didn't know
Epilepsy/seizure disabilities is a category of disability

# C. Assistive Technologies and Adaptive Strategies

# D. Demographics and Statistics

# E. Disability Etiquette

## Stuff I didn't know
Some preferences for language:
- Prefer "Person without disabilities/has a disability" to "disabled person/people".
- Prefer "People without disabilities" to "able bodied".

Going to change some text above because of this.
