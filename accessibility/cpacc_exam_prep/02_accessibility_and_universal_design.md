# A. Accomodations and Universal Design
## Overview
Universal Design = things made for EVERYONE

Without universal design, those with disabilities may need accomodations to do the same things. With
universal design, everyone has access **without needing additional accomodations**.

Also known as **inclusive design** and **design for all**.

## User Diversity
Universal design should target 99% of people:
- 21% of people with no difficulties
- 16% of people with minimal difficulties
- 37% of people with mild difficulties
- 25% of people with severe difficulties

(The remaining 1% require "Specialist products" - see
http://www.inclusivedesigntoolkit.com/whatis/whatis.html#p30 )

## Seven Principles of Universal Design
1. Equitable Use
  - **Design is useful for people with diverse abilities**, e.g. an automatically opening door
  - Same means of use for all users: identical where possible, equivalent when not. Avoid
    segregating users.
2. Flexibility in Use
  - **Accomodate a wide range of preferences and abilities**, e.g. ambidextrous scissors
3. Simple and Intuitive Use
  - **Design is easy to understand, regardless of experience, knowledge, language skills, or
    conecentration level**
  - Reduce complexity, and arrange information with regards to importance - e.g. fire alarm levers
    etc
4. Perceptible Information
  - **Communicate necessary information to the user regardles off conditions or sensory
    capabilities**
  - Use different modes (pictorial, verbal, auditory, tactile) for redundant presentation of
    essential information, e.g. announcements and signage at airports for departures.
5. Tolerance for Error
  - **Minimize hazards and adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions**
  - Fail safe, not fail deadly
  - Provide warnings and discourage unconscious use in tasks that require vigilance
  - e.g. double cut car key, providing error information and forms and not making submission time
    limited
6. Low Physical Effort
  - **Allow for efficient and comfortable use**
  - Allow user to maintain neutral body position, use reasonable operating forces, and minimise
    repetitive actions (no button mashing!!)
  - E.g. touch lamps, voice activation/control
7. Size and Approach for Use
  - **Provide appropriate size and space for approach, reach, manipulation and use regardless of
    user's body size, posture, or mobility**
  - Make things physically reachable, visible, etc for both standing and seated (e.g. wheelchair)
    users
  - Accomodate variations in hand and grip size (grip strength is principle 6)
  - e.g. Wide gates at Tube stations, keyboard operability of software

## Accomodations
Reasonable adjustments for people with disabilities to give them equal access to education or
employment. Individualised to the person.

Accomodations are protected by legislation, which varies by country. For example, in the US:
- Accomodations are not required if it places an undue burden to the organisation OR
- If the accomodation is so significant it alters the essential nature of the good, service,
  facility, job, etc.

Examples of accomodations in education:
- Additional test time
- Being able to use a computer to write
- Materials in braille

Examples of accomodation in employment:
- Lowering/raising desk
- Ensuring websites and IT systems are accessible
- Providing assistive technologies
- Supporting work from home and alternative/flexible work schedules.

# B. Benefits of Accessibility

# C. Web Accessibility
## Overview
WCAG = Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

Layers of guidance:
- 4 high-level principles
- 13 general guidelines
- 78 testable success criteria
- An illustrative collection of techniques and common failures

### The 4 Principles
Using the POUR mnemonic:
- Perceivable
- Operable
- Understandable
- Robust

### 3 Levels of WCAG
We most commonly expect at least AA.
1. A: Fundamental barriers to access. Level A provides minimal accessibility.
2. AA: All of A plus more nuanced barriers. AA provides accessibility for most people.
3. AAA: Includes A and AA, most difficult to achieve.

## Perceivable
Use multiple different senses
- alt-text for images
- Captions for audio
- Semantic content
- Consider low colour vision and contrast

## Operable
Users have to be able to use the interface
- Allow keyboards to do everything
- Give users enough time to read and use content
- Don't create rapidly flashing content
- Skip to main content links
- Allow for inputs beyond a keyboard - touch screen, voice, etc

## Understandable
Users have to be able understand the content, not just operate it.
- Make content readable and understandable - e.g. identify language of content
- Make content predictable - don't shift layout from page to page
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes - e.g. in forms, spellcheck, etc

## Robust
Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents,
including assistive technologies.
- Maximise compatibility with current and future user tools - e.g. correctly identify the name, role
  and value for elements

# D. Universal Design for Learning
## Overview
> Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is a framework of principles and guidelines for minimizing
> barriers and maximizing learning. It emphasizes flexibility by asking teachers to provide multiple
> ways of presenting information and learning activities, and in the ways that students can
> demonstrate their knowledge.

## Multiple Means of Engagement
Make students care about what they're learning.
- Interest: Spark excitement and curiosity
- Sustaining effort and persistence: Tackle challenges with focus and determination
- Self-regulation: Harness the power of emotions and motivation in learning

## Multiple Means of Representation
Present the information in different ways to cater to different preferences and abilities (and also
reinforce preceding presentations of information).

Provide options for:
- Perception: Interact in multiple different modes. Classic visual/auditory/kinaesthetic
- Language and symbols: Communicate through languages that create a shared understanding (?)
- Comprehension: Construct meaning and generate new understandings

## Multiple Means of Action and Expression
Provide learners different ways of showing they understand something they've learned.

Provide options for:
- Physical action: interact with materials and tools
- Expression and communication
- Executive function

Examples: Calculators, geometric sketchpads; posted goals, objectives; software that works
seamlessley with keyboard alternatives

# E. Usability and User Experience (UX)
## Key Terms
Accessibility - the means by which people can perceive, understand, navigate and interact with
things.

Usability - focuses on ease of use. Someone should be able to easily access something, use it, and
complete their desired task. A highly usable product reduces cognitive load so the user can achieve
their goals quickly. A highly usable product is also accessible (allows for diverse and equivalent
means of use)

Cognitive load - refers to the amount of effort exerted/required while reasoning and thinking. When
this load is high, thought processes are potentially interfered with, which is an issue. Someone
might lose track of their overall goal if they have to concern themselves with the specifics of
interacting with something.

User experience (UX) - includes usability, but is comprehensive of a person's end-to-end experience
with the thing, including the emotional dimension: desire, joy, meaning, reflection, value or
frustration that they experience.

## Differences Between Usability and User Experience.
### Usability
Usability is a **part** of UX.

Three key needs to consider with usability:
- Easy to use for the first time
- Users must be able to achieve goal efficiently
- It should be memorable so later uses can be even more efficient

### User Experience
Concerned with the **entire journey** a user has in encountering, using and revisting something,
including:
- Becoming aware of the thing
- Acquiring or accessing it
- Using it for the first time
- Using it subsequent times
- One's feelings about it

Core components of UX:
- Usability
- Usefulness
- Desirability
- Accessibility
- Credibility (user must be able to trust the product, in terms of quality, security and privacy)

### Accessibility and Usability
Accessibility and usability are parts of each other.

However, while accessibility has concrete standards, there are none for usability. Evaluating
usability involves both qualitative and quantitative methods; accessibility is mostly quantitative
(since the criteria is mostly objective).
