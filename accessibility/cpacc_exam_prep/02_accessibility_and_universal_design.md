# A. Accomodations and Universal Design
## Overview
Universal Design = things made for EVERYONE

Without universal design, those with disabilities may need accomodations to do the same things. With
universal design, everyone has access **without needing additional accomodations**.

Also known as **inclusive design** and **design for all**.

## User Diversity
Universal design should target 99% of people:
- 21% of people with no difficulties
- 16% of people with minimal difficulties
- 37% of people with mild difficulties
- 25% of people with severe difficulties

(The remaining 1% require "Specialist products" - see
http://www.inclusivedesigntoolkit.com/whatis/whatis.html#p30 )

## Seven Principles of Universal Design
1. Equitable Use
  - **Design is useful for people with diverse abilities**, e.g. an automatically opening door
  - Same means of use for all users: identical where possible, equivalent when not. Avoid
    segregating users.
2. Flexibility in Use
  - **Accomodate a wide range of preferences and abilities**, e.g. ambidextrous scissors
3. Simple and Intuitive Use
  - **Design is easy to understand, regardless of experience, knowledge, language skills, or
    conecentration level**
  - Reduce complexity, and arrange information with regards to importance - e.g. fire alarm levers
    etc
4. Perceptible Information
  - **Communicate necessary information to the user regardles off conditions or sensory
    capabilities**
  - Use different modes (pictorial, verbal, auditory, tactile) for redundant presentation of
    essential information, e.g. announcements and signage at airports for departures.
5. Tolerance for Error
  - **Minimize hazards and adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions**
  - Fail safe, not fail deadly
  - Provide warnings and discourage unconscious use in tasks that require vigilance
  - e.g. double cut car key, providing error information and forms and not making submission time
    limited
6. Low Physical Effort
  - **Allow for efficient and comfortable use**
  - Allow user to maintain neutral body position, use reasonable operating forces, and minimise
    repetitive actions (no button mashing!!)
  - E.g. touch lamps, voice activation/control
7. Size and Approach for Use
  - **Provide appropriate size and space for approach, reach, manipulation and use regardless of
    user's body size, posture, or mobility**
  - Make things physically reachable, visible, etc for both standing and seated (e.g. wheelchair)
    users
  - Accomodate variations in hand and grip size (grip strength is principle 6)
  - e.g. Wide gates at Tube stations, keyboard operability of software

## Accomodations
Reasonable adjustments for people with disabilities to give them equal access to education or
employment. Individualised to the person.

Accomodations are protected by legislation, which varies by country. For example, in the US:
- Accomodations are not required if it places an undue burden to the organisation OR
- If the accomodation is so significant it alters the essential nature of the good, service,
  facility, job, etc.

Examples of accomodations in education:
- Additional test time
- Being able to use a computer to write
- Materials in braille

Examples of accomodation in employment:
- Lowering/raising desk
- Ensuring websites and IT systems are accessible
- Providing assistive technologies
- Supporting work from home and alternative/flexible work schedules.
