# AZ-104: Prerequisites for Azure administrators
Link to the learning path:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/az-104-administrator-prerequisites

This path itself has 3 other learning paths as prerequisites:
1. [Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: Describe cloud
   concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/microsoft-azure-fundamentals-describe-cloud-concepts/)
2. [Azure Fundamentals: Describe Azure architecture and
   services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/azure-fundamentals-describe-azure-architecture-services/)
3. [Azure Fundamentals: Describe Azure management and
   governance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/describe-azure-management-governance/)

I would have created subdirectories for those paths but I'm on the third one right now and I only
just thought to take notes. To reflect these prequisites in notes I will compile them all in
[`00_initial_impressions.md`](00_initial_impressions.md).
