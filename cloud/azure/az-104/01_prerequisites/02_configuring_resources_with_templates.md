Link: [Configure resources with Azure Resource Manager templates
](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/configure-resources-arm-templates/)

Benefits of templates according to MS:
- Improve consistency
- Help express complex deployments
- Reduce manual tasks
- Templates are code, so can be tracked in version control
- Promote reuse
- Are linkable ("You can link Resource Manager templates together to make the templates themselves
  modular. You can write small templates that each define a piece of a solution, and then combine
  them to create a complete system.")
- Simplify orchestration (deploy multiple resources with just one command)
