Not too interested in this so I'm just going to skim this learning path and only take notes if I see
something... notable.

Really nothing interesting so far. It's nice how the PowerShell module has consistent naming for the
cmdlets - once you get data about a resource (e.g. `Get-AzDisk`), you can pipe it into a
correspondingly named command to remove it (`Remove-AzDisk`).
- This even works if the Get cmdlet returns multiple resources, which is nice
