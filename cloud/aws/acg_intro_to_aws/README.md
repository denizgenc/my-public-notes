# A Cloud Guru - Introduction to AWS
Seems to be roughly equivalent to AWS' own "AWS Technical Essentials" course
(https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/classroom-training/aws-technical-essentials.pdf)
- ACG's course does seem to be missing something that covers the "Monitoring, Optimization, and
  Serverless" module...
- I'm not covering the Machine Learning chapter because it's not part of the Technical Essentials
  course
