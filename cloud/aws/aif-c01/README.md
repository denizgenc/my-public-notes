# AWS Certified AI Practitioner (AIF-C01) cert notes

Assorted notes to get ready for this cert.

I'm going to be following AWS' own "Standard Exam Prep Plan", available here:
https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/learning-plans/2193/plan - however it's marked as
"[RETIRING]" so I probably decided to start studying for this cert at a bad time

## Objectives
From the [exam
guide](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-ai-practitioner/AWS-Certified-AI-Practitioner_Exam-Guide.pdf):
- Demonstrate general knowledge of AI/ML, generative AI, and AWS services that enable them
- Understand the appropriate use of these technologies
- Know how to pick the right AI/ML technology for different use cases
- Learn how to use this tech responsibly

## Exam content
Again, from the exam guide linked above, there are multiple choice questions (one correct option out
of four), multiple response questions (two or more correct out of five response options), ordering
questions, and matching questions (a list of response to match with a list of 3-7 prompts)
- Partial credit is **not** awarded for questions. You have to get everything right (e.g. choosing
  all the correct responses for a multiple response question) for a single point.
- There are case study questions which present a situation about which two or more questions will be
  about.

### Exam results
You get a pass or fail for the exam. You get a scaled score from 100 - 1000; a passing score is 700.

## Outline
The exam guide mentions that there are **five domains** for this certification, which have different
weightings for the exam:
1. Fundamentals of AI and ML (20% of scored content)
2. Fundamentals of Generative AI (24% of scored content)
3. Applications of Foundation Models (28% of scored content)
4. Guidelines for Responsible AI (14% of scored content)
5. Security, Compliance and Governance for AI Solutions (14% of scored content)

I'm going to go over the "task statements" for the different domains here, but you should look into
the [exam
guide](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-ai-practitioner/AWS-Certified-AI-Practitioner_Exam-Guide.pdf)
for all the details (including the learning objectives for each task statement).
